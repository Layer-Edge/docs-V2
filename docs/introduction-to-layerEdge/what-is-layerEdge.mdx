# What is LayerEdge?

**LayerEdge** is a decentralized verification layer that enables scalable, cost-efficient, and secure zk-proof verification on Bitcoin. It is designed to serve as a universal infrastructure layer for verifying off-chain computation—including rollup state transitions, ZK-based applications, AI inference proofs, IoT data attestations, and more—by anchoring zk-proofs to Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) for finality.

LayerEdge transforms Bitcoin from a passive financial ledger into a cryptographic trust layer that verifies computation without executing it.

### Key Capabilities

**zk-Proof Aggregation**

LayerEdge aggregates multiple zk-proofs $(\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_n)$ from various protocols into a single recursive proof $\pi_{\text{agg}}$. This reduces the verification complexity from **O(n)** to **O(log n)** and significantly lowers the cost and data size of anchoring proofs on-chain.

### Bitcoin Anchoring

The final aggregated proof is committed to the Bitcoin blockchain using one of several anchoring methods:

* `OP_RETURN` (currently supported)
* `Taproot` scripts with MAST for private, conditional verification
* Future support for `OP_CAT` to enable concatenated script parsing and even cheaper native verification

### Universal Proof Compatibility

LayerEdge supports zk-proofs generated by a wide variety of cryptographic engines:

* **SNARKs**: Groth16, PLONK, Halo2, Nova
* **STARKs**: Fractal, AirSTARK
* **ZKVMs**: RISC Zero, SP1
* **Hybrids**: PlonKy2, Nexus

Each proof is normalized into a common internal format, allowing LayerEdge to treat all systems as input-agnostic and easily aggregate them.

  }}
/>

LayerEdge is composed of four modular subsystems:

### 1. Verification Layer

* Receives raw zk-proofs from protocols
* Normalizes them into a canonical format
* Validates structure and sanity
* Exposes APIs (e.g., gRPC) for proof submission

### 2. General Aggregator / Verifier

* Aggregates proofs recursively using circuits like Halo2, Nova, or Spartan
* Uses binary trees or batch fan-ins to minimize recursive depth
* Produces a single final proof πₐgg representing the validity of all prior computations

### 3. Data Availability Layer (DAL)

* Implements a sovereign Cosmos-based chain for storing proof commitments
* Organizes proof data into Merkle trees
* Provides Merkle paths and auditability for light clients

### 4. Bitcoin Anchoring Layer

* Commits πₐgg to Bitcoin using script-level logic
* Guarantees immutability, censorship resistance, and high economic finality
* In future, supports modular anchoring upgrades using OP_CAT

## Light Node Verification

LayerEdge introduces **probabilistic light node verification**:

* Each light node validates only a random subset of proofs from the aggregate
* Randomness is derived from **Bitcoin block headers + verifiable random functions (VRFs)**
* This model achieves **exponential fraud detection probability** with minimal compute per node

This architecture ensures that even lightweight participants can contribute to security without needing to process every proof—drastically lowering hardware requirements and enabling broad decentralization.

## Trust-Minimized Infrastructure for All

With its ZK-native architecture, recursive aggregation, and Bitcoin anchoring, LayerEdge allows:

* Rollups to offload proof validation while inheriting Bitcoin's security
* DePIN/IoT devices to attest to events using succinct ZKPs
* AI systems to validate inference claims without leaking internal weights or inputs
* Modular blockchains to rely on a shared verification layer, avoiding redundant verifier setups

---

LayerEdge is:

* A decentralized zk-verification layer
* Powered by recursive aggregation and probabilistic validation
* Anchored on Bitcoin's PoW for finality and tamper-resistance
* Designed to serve any application that requires trust-minimized proof validation

It unlocks scalable zk-infrastructure without compromising on decentralization, trust, or economic viability.
