# Universal Validator Set (UVS)

## Overview of UVS

The Universal Validator Set (UVS) is the backbone of LayerEdge, enabling trust-minimized operations for zk-protocols by running full validator nodes. UVS validators play a critical role in validating zk-proofs, and ensuring secure settlements on Bitcoin.

UVS validators are incentivized through a reward mechanism, which is tied to their stake on Babylon and LayerEdge. This document provides a detailed guide on how UVS runners are rewarded and how they can maximize their earnings.

## UVS Validation Process

The diagram below illustrates the flow of the UVS validation process:

1. **Stake BTC via Babylon**: Validators stake BTC to provide economic security
2. **Restaked BTC Enables UVS**: BTC is restaked to power LayerEdge's UVS system
3. **Validation**: UVS nodes validate zk-proofs for efficient Bitcoin settlement
4. **Trust-Minimized Settlement**: Aggregated proofs are settled on Bitcoin, ensuring secure and transparent operations
5. **\$EDGEN Staking for Boosted Rewards**: Validators can stake $EDGEN tokens to earn higher rewards and additional benefits


## How to Become a UVS Runner

1. **Restake BTC via Babylon**: To participate as a UVS validator, you must first stake BTC through Babylon's restaking mechanism. This restaking ensures economic security for the LayerEdge network and zk-protocols utilizing its infrastructure.

2. **Run a Full Validator Node**: Once BTC is restaked, you will be eligible to run a full validator node for LayerEdge. As a UVS runner, your node will:
   * Validate proofs from multiple zk-protocols on leaf level
   * Validate the final aggregated proof before settling on Bitcoin

3. **Earn Base Rewards**: By staking BTC and running a UVS node, you will receive base rewards as part of LayerEdge's validator reward mechanism. These rewards are distributed based on the economic security you provide through restaked BTC.

## Boosting Rewards with $EDGEN Staking

To unlock higher-tier rewards, UVS runners can stake $EDGEN tokens in addition to their restaked BTC. This staking mechanism incentivizes validators to align more closely with LayerEdge's ecosystem and ensures better economic participation.

### Reward Tiers

* **Base Tier**: Rewards for validators restaking BTC via Babylon
* **Boosted Tier**: Additional rewards for validators who stake \$EDGEN tokens. The more \$EDGEN tokens staked, the higher the reward multiplier

### Key Benefits of \$EDGEN Staking

* **Higher Rewards**: Staking \$EDGEN tokens significantly increases the reward potential for UVS runners
* **Governance Rights**: Staked \$EDGEN tokens provide governance rights, enabling validators to participate in LayerEdge's decision-making processes

## Reward Distribution Mechanism

Rewards are distributed periodically and are calculated based on:

1. **Restaked BTC**: The amount of BTC restaked via Babylon
2. **\$EDGEN Staked**: The total \$EDGEN tokens staked by the validator
3. **Validation Activity**: The performance and uptime of the UVS node

### Reward Calculation

* **Base Reward**: Proportional to the amount of BTC restaked
* **Bonus Multiplier**: Based on the amount of $EDGEN tokens staked
* **Performance Factor**: Rewards are adjusted based on the validator's contribution to proof validation

> Example: A UVS runner with 1 BTC restaked via Babylon and 1,000 \$EDGEN staked will earn significantly more rewards compared to a runner with only 1 BTC restaked and no \$EDGEN staked.

## Responsibilities of UVS Runners

1. **Maintain Node Uptime**: Ensure your validator node operates consistently with minimal downtime. Performance penalties may apply for prolonged inactivity
2. **Validate zk-Proofs**: Process proofs from various zk-protocols accurately and efficiently
3. **Stake Maintenance**: Regularly monitor and manage your BTC and $EDGEN stakes to maximize rewards

## Key Benefits of Being a UVS Runner

1. **Earning Potential**: UVS runners earn competitive rewards for their contributions to the LayerEdge network. By staking both BTC and \$EDGEN, validators can maximize their income
2. **Economic Security Alignment**: Restaking BTC via Babylon ensures that UVS runners contribute directly to the economic security of the LayerEdge network
3. **Modular Ecosystem Support**: UVS runners play a critical role in supporting zk-protocols and decentralized applications, contributing to a scalable and modular Bitcoin ecosystem
4. **Governance Rights**: Validators staking \$EDGEN tokens gain governance influence, allowing them to shape the future of the LayerEdge network

## Join the UVS Network

If you're ready to participate as a UVS runner and contribute to the next evolution of Bitcoin zk protocols, get started today by:

1. Staking BTC through Babylon
2. Setting up your full validator node
3. Staking \$EDGEN tokens to maximize rewards
