# Consensus

LayerEdge employs Proof Of Aggregation (PoAgg) for network consensus, combining Proof of Stake security with specialized proof validation architecture. This mechanism operates through a dual validation model: validators secure the network through staked tokens while simultaneously performing distributed proof verification and aggregated state validations. The network achieves consensus not just on transaction state but also on proof validity and aggregation sequence, enabling efficient proof processing at scale.

## Consensus Components

* **Proof of Stake base layer** for network security
* **Distributed proof validation** framework
* **Sequenced aggregation** protocol
* **Multi-layer state** finalization

This hybrid approach ensures both network security and efficient proof processing, creating a mechanism specifically optimized for proof aggregation infrastructure.
