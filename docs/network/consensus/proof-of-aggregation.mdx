# Proof Of Aggregation (PoAgg)

## Overview

Proof of Aggregation is LayerEdge's novel consensus mechanism that enables efficient proof verification and aggregation while maintaining security. The system combines traditional blockchain consensus with specialized proof handling capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Validator Network

* Validators stake EDGEN tokens to participate
* Responsible for block production and validation
* Verify proofs at leaf level before aggregation
* Participate in consensus for block finalization

### 2. Block Production Process

* Validators validate consecutive blocks (#n, #n+1, etc.)
* Each block contains aggregated proofs from multiple sources
* Validators receive rewards for:
  * Block validation
  * Proof verification
  * Participation in consensus

### 3. Proof Aggregation Layer

The proof aggregation process occurs in three distinct phases:

#### Phase 1: Pre-aggregation Storage

* Individual proofs are received from various sources
* Proofs are securely stored in a pre-aggregation layer
* Initial validation checks are performed

#### Phase 2: Leaf-level Verification

* Validators perform detailed verification of individual proofs
* Each proof is checked for validity before aggregation
* Failed proofs are rejected at this stage

#### Phase 3: Proof Aggregation

* Valid proofs enter the aggregation sequencer
* Multiple proofs are combined efficiently
* Final aggregated proof is produced
* Aggregated proof is settled on Layer 1 (Bitcoin)

## Validator Rewards

Validators receive rewards from multiple sources:

1. Block production rewards
2. Proof verification rewards
3. Aggregation participation rewards

## Security Model

### Staking

* Validators must stake EDGEN tokens
* Stake serves as security deposit
* Slashing conditions for malicious behavior

### Verification

* Multi-level verification process
* Leaf-level proof checking
* Aggregate proof validation
* Cross-validation among validators

## Settlement Process

1. Final aggregated proof is generated
2. Proof is verified by validator network
3. Settlement transaction is prepared
4. Proof is posted to Layer 1 (Bitcoin)

## Network Benefits

1. **Cost Efficiency**
   * Shared verification costs
   * Reduced settlement expenses
   * Efficient resource utilization

2. **Security**
   * Multi-layer validation
   * Economic incentives for honest behavior
   * Robust slashing conditions

3. **Scalability**
   * Parallel proof processing
   * Efficient aggregation
   * Optimized settlement
