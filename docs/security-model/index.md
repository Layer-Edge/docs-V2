# Security Model

LayerEdge is architected for verifiable trust at scale — not by relying on centralized actors, but through a layered security model grounded in cryptography, Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work, and economic game theory.

The protocol's security guarantees are not limited to zk-proofs alone — LayerEdge incorporates a holistic defense mechanism that:

* Anchors verification results on Bitcoin for finality
* Leverages advanced cryptographic primitives like zk-SNARKs, STARKs, Taproot, and Lamport signatures
* Distributes validation to a decentralized set of Light Nodes using probabilistic sampling
* Aligns incentives via slashing, bounties, and token rewards to discourage dishonest behavior

## What You'll Learn in This Section

In the pages that follow, we'll cover the full scope of how LayerEdge ensures verifiability, data integrity, and network honesty:

* **Bitcoin's PoW Anchoring**: How finality and tamper-resistance are derived from anchoring proofs directly on Bitcoin's main chain.
* **Advanced Cryptographic Protections**: A breakdown of the zk-proof systems used, scripting mechanisms like Taproot, and quantum-resilient signature schemes.
* **Probabilistic Sampling & Light Node Security**: How decentralized Light Nodes verify proofs using randomized selection, making fraud detection exponentially more secure.
* **Economic & Game-Theoretic Incentives**: How bounties, penalties, and token rewards keep the network aligned and honest without central enforcement.

## Why It Matters

In a trust-minimized system, security must be embedded in the protocol — not enforced by institutions or privileged validators. LayerEdge's design ensures:

* Every proof anchored is verifiable and economically irreversible
* Fraud is detectably punishable by design
* Participation is open and secure for honest actors, regardless of size or geography

Whether you're a protocol integrating with LayerEdge, a Light Node operator, or a researcher evaluating system robustness — this section provides the complete picture of how LayerEdge defends its decentralized trust fabric.
