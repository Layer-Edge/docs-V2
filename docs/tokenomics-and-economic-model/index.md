# Tokenomics & Economic Model

LayerEdge's token economy is engineered to create a **self-sustaining, decentralized verification network**—backed by real utility and driven by economic incentives.

By combining **reward-driven participation**, **native token utility**, and **usage-based demand**, LayerEdge ensures that its verification infrastructure can scale globally without sacrificing decentralization, security, or long-term viability.

This section explores the core components of LayerEdge's economic design, including:

- **Utility of the LayerEdge token** as a medium of exchange for verification and settlement
- **Incentive mechanisms** that reward honest behavior from Light Nodes and Full Nodes
- **Token demand models** and the mathematical correlation to network usage
- **Reward distribution frameworks** based on client payments and protocol performance
- **Token flow and equilibrium** models balancing demand, issuance, and validator compensation
- **Strategic levers** like dynamic fees, slashing, and inflation control—ensuring sustainability at scale

## Why Tokenomics Matters

At its core, LayerEdge exists to verify decentralized computation across a wide range of ecosystems—rollups, zkVMs, AI inference layers, identity protocols, and more.

But trust-minimized verification only works if the network stays honest, cost-effective, and economically viable over time.

That's where LayerEdge's tokenomics comes in:

- It provides **economic security guarantees** for the network
- Encourages wide participation in validation
- And ensures that verification costs are equitably shared across all participating protocols

This creates a **positive-sum loop** where more usage → higher token demand → more rewards → better security → even more usage.
