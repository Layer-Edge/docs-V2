### Breakdown

#### Community
**410,000,000 EDGEN (41% of total supply)**

The largest allocation of EDGEN goes to the people who power the LayerEdge network—network participants, verifiers, and active contributors. These funds are specifically to be used to grow the LayerEdge community, and incentivise them at every stage of their contribution.

At TGE, **58.54% of this allocation (24% of total supply)** will be initially unlocked to reward early community participation. The remaining **41.46%** will linearly vest over 4 years to ensure long-term alignment with the LayerEdge ecosystem.

Out of the **24%** of **total EDGEN supply** unlocked at TGE for the community, **8%** is allocated to the initial airdrop, fully unlocked at launch, while another **2%** is reserved for OG Pledge Pass holders, also fully unlocked. An additional **2%** is designated for the initial staking reward pool, which will remain locked at TGE. To support market access and trading activity, **4%** is allocated to on-chain liquidity and **8%** is earmarked for centralized exchange listings and liquidity needs. This 8% will be strategically deployed across multiple CEX listings and reserved for upcoming community campaign initiatives in the following months.

#### Community Round (IDO)
**50,000,000 EDGEN (5% of total supply)**

This is the most direct way for LayerEdge network participants and supporters to become token holders. Conducted as a community round raise, this discounted round is open via whitelist for 1 hour exclusively to our community (Testnet Phase I & Phase II) at an exclusive FDV.

For any unsold allocations from our community in the first hour, the community round will then be live for everyone for the next 23 hours or until sold.

The tokens in the Community Round will be unlocked 100% at TGE.

This round gives early community members the best entry—because participation isn't gated by capital, but by contribution.

#### Early Backers
**50,000,000 EDGEN (5% of total supply)**

Our earliest backers supported the vision when LayerEdge was still in its earliest stages. This includes angel investors and strategic funds who believed in our journey.

These tokens have a **12-month cliff** and **15-month linear vesting**, ensuring early capital is aligned with long-term impact.

#### Core Contributors
**220,000,000 EDGEN (22% of total supply)**

The engineers, designers, operators, and builders behind LayerEdge have worked to push the people backed internet from concept to reality. This allocation covers both current team members and future hires needed to scale the protocol and attract the best talent in the space.

Contributor tokens are locked with a **12-month cliff** followed by **4 years linear vesting**—ensuring long-term alignment and sustainable development.

#### Ecosystem & R&D
**150,000,000 EDGEN (15% of total supply)**

This allocation is reserved for protocol-level R&D, integrations with external zk-proof systems, expansion into new ecosystems (e.g., Cosmos, Solana), and research into advanced zkVM support, frameworks, and economic coordination layers.

It also powers grants, developer incentives, ecosystem development and verifier integrations with external rollups and apps. A portion of the Ecosystem & R&D might be used for community initiatives within the LayerEdge Ecosystem in future, that enables the ecosystem growth.

Tokens will **vest linearly over 4 years from TGE.** LayerEdge treats R&D not as a side initiative—but the backbone of continuous evolution.

#### Foundation
**120,000,000 EDGEN (12% of total supply)**

The LayerEdge Foundation stewards the development and governance framework of the protocol, manages legal and compliance operations, ensures long-term decentralization of network upgrades, and leads education, and cross-chain coordination efforts.

These tokens are locked with a **3-month cliff, linearly vested over 3 years.**

This ensures the Foundation is incentivized to grow the LayerEdge protocol transparently and with long-term community alignment.
