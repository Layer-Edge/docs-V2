# General Prover / Verifier System

## Purpose and Role

The **General Prover / Verifier System** is the **cryptographic heart** of LayerEdge’s verification architecture. It is responsible for **recursively aggregating multiple normalized zk-proofs into a single succinct proof**, dramatically reducing verification overhead.

By shifting computational effort to provers and compressing proof size, this system enables LayerEdge to provide a universal, scalable, and cost-effective zk-verification layer — verifiable natively on Bitcoin.

This module is essential to:
- Make zk-verification viable at scale
- Minimize on-chain costs and bandwidth
- Allow Bitcoin to act as the universal **final settlement layer** without needing to verify every individual proof directly

## Core Components

### 1. Aggregation Circuits

Aggregation circuits are special zk-circuits that receive multiple zk-proofs as inputs and output a new, single zk-proof that asserts the correctness of all previous ones.

Depending on the design and cryptographic primitives used, LayerEdge supports multiple backends:

- **Halo2**: Optimized for recursive SNARKs with plonkish constraints and native curve support
- **Nova**: Recursive-friendly architecture using relaxed R1CS + additive commitments
- **Spartan**: Transparent ZK-SNARK design using polynomial IOPs, suitable for low-trust setups
- **Plonky3**: Highly performant, recursive STARK-compatible system designed for low-latency aggregation

Each circuit is tailored to balance:
- Prover time
- Constraint efficiency
- Field compatibility 
- Recursion depth

### 2. Recursive Composition Logic

Recursive aggregation is built using binary or fan-in trees, where each level of the tree performs one round of proof aggregation.

- **Leaf Nodes**: Individual normalized zk-proofs
- **Internal Nodes**: Aggregation steps (pairwise or batched)
- **Root Node**: Final output — a single zk-proof representing the validity of all the original inputs

This structure ensures:
- **Logarithmic recursion depth**
- High parallelism
- Efficient memory usage across large batches

## Aggregation Mechanism

### Pairwise Aggregation

Let:

- $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ be two zk-proofs

The aggregation circuit receives $(\pi_A, \pi_B)$ along with their public inputs and outputs a single proof $\pi_{AB}$. This proof internally verifies the validity of both $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$, and encodes a combined validity statement.

This is repeated recursively until the full set is reduced to a single $\pi_{agg}$.

---

### Multi-Proof Batching

Some implementations support batching multiple proofs at once (e.g., 8, 16, 32 proofs per round), reducing recursion depth further.

Advantages:
- Lower number of aggregation rounds
- Reduced memory overhead
- Fewer final circuit evaluations

Batching may require:
- **Custom aggregation gates** in the underlying circuit
- **Polynomial commitment schemes** like:
  - **KZG** (used in PLONK, for succinct SNARK aggregation)
  - **FRI** (used in STARKs, for scalable transparent batching)

---

## Final Aggregated Proof

After log(n) steps, a single **final proof** is produced.

$$
\pi_{agg} = \bigoplus(\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n)V(\pi_{agg}) = \bigwedge_{i=1}^n V(\pi_i)
$$

Where:

- $\bigoplus$ is the recursive aggregation function embedded in the circuit
- $V$ is the verification logic proving that each original zk-proof $\pi_i$ is valid

If $\pi_{agg}$ verifies correctly, then every $\pi_i$ has also been validated — with only a **single proof and one verification call**.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Constraint Optimization

Each aggregation circuit is optimized for low constraint count and fast recursive verification:

- **R1CS minimization** in Groth16 or Spartan-based circuits
- **Custom gates** for curve and hash operations (e.g., Poseidon, Rescue)
- **No stdlib bloat** — only essential constraints are compiled into each aggregation layer

This ensures:
- Provers can generate recursive proofs quickly
- Verifiers (especially on-chain or light clients) can validate with minimal cost

---

### Prover vs Verifier Load

One of the core design principles of LayerEdge is to **shift computational burden away from verifiers** and toward provers.

- Provers handle recursive composition, curve arithmetic, hashing, and polynomial openings
- Verifiers simply check one small aggregated proof
- This trade-off makes the system scalable and friendly for low-resource verifiers (e.g., Light Nodes)

---

### Parallel Aggregation Trees

LayerEdge’s recursive trees are designed for **horizontal scaling**:

- Subtrees can be aggregated in parallel across threads or machines
- Aggregator clients can split and merge branches independently
- Perfect for GPU, ASIC, or distributed proof-generation setups

This enables **high-throughput batch verification** — suitable for handling rollups, zk-oracles, and machine-learning ZK pipelines concurrently.

## Key Benefits

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Recursive Aggregation | Scales to thousands of proofs with log(n) recursion steps |
| Minimal On-Chain Load | Only one final proof is submitted and verified |
| Parallelism | Subtrees can be built concurrently for high throughput |
| Efficient Circuit Design | Custom constraint logic for low prover/verifier cost |
| Proof System Agnostic | Works with multiple zk backends (Halo2, Nova, Plonky3, etc.) |
| Strong Soundness Guarantees | Final $\pi_{agg}$ implies all input proofs are valid |

## Summary

The General Prover / Verifier System turns LayerEdge into a **scalable zk-verification fabric**, where:

- zk-proofs from any protocol are ingested
- Recursively aggregated into a single succinct proof
- Efficiently verified by Bitcoin or LayerEdge Light Nodes

This system is what makes the vision of **trustless, cost-efficient, Bitcoin-secured computation at scale** possible.
