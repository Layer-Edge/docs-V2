# Modular Verification on Bitcoin

LayerEdge supports **modular verification** of off-chain state transitions by **splitting complex updates into verifiable sub-transitions**, each backed by its own succinct proof. These sub-proofs (or their hashes/commitments) are **anchored to Bitcoin periodically**, ensuring tamper-evidence, transparency, and challengeability.

This modularity enhances **granularity, scalability, and fault isolation** within the State Transition Verification (STV) process.

## Anchoring Sub-Transitions

Rather than representing an entire rollup state evolution with a single zk-proof, LayerEdge supports anchoring of **multiple modular sub-proofs**.

Each sub-transition has:

* Its own **zk-SNARK or zk-STARK**
* A commitment (e.g., Merkle leaf or direct hash)
* A timestamped anchoring operation on Bitcoin via Taproot, OP_RETURN, or in future, OP_CAT

These sub-proofs are periodically posted or committed to Bitcoin, offering an immutable checkpoint history of system state evolution.

## Why Modular Proofs?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Granularity** | Each sub-transition can be verified individually, enabling fine-grained fraud detection. |
| **Parallelism** | Independent sub-proofs can be computed, verified, and disputed in parallel — optimizing system throughput. |
| **Challenge Efficiency** | Disputes can be scoped to just one sub-transition instead of an entire batch or epoch. |

This model **dramatically improves verification efficiency and fault tolerance** in high-throughput environments.

## Challenging a Transition

The system is designed for **open verification and dispute resolution**. If an entity observes any incorrect transition, they can initiate a formal challenge.

### Detecting a Suspicious State

* Participants (e.g., Light Nodes or external watchtowers) constantly monitor the state roots and sub-transition commitments.
* If any proof appears **malformed, incorrect, or inconsistent**, they can trigger a challenge.

### Submitting a Dispute — `T_disprove`

If a sub-transition appears invalid:

1. A **T_disprove transaction** is posted on Bitcoin or LayerEdge's verification chain.
2. This transaction includes:
   * The index of the faulty sub-transition
   * The raw data for re-verification
   * A potentially contradictory proof or claim

The **on-chain verifier logic** is then triggered to compare the submitted proof to the expected transition function output.

### Proving Fraud

If the sub-proof fails validation:

* The entire **batch containing that sub-transition is invalidated**
* The **operator or aggregator is penalized**
* The **challenger is rewarded** (see 4.3 for details on incentive design)

This approach ensures that **fraudulent computation is always traceable and punishable**, without forcing the system to re-check everything.

## System Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sub-Transition Splitting** | State updates are broken into fine-grained components, each verifiable independently. |
| **Anchoring Method** | Each sub-proof or Merkle root is posted to Bitcoin (e.g., Taproot, OP_RETURN). |
| **Dispute Flow** | Any participant can challenge a specific sub-transition using `T_disprove`. |
| **On-Chain Verification** | Disputed proofs are re-verified on Bitcoin or LayerEdge chain with full cryptographic integrity. |
| **Security Outcome** | Invalid transitions lead to slashing of malicious actors and reward for challengers. |

Modular verification ensures that LayerEdge remains:

* **Scalable**: by parallelizing validation
* **Auditable**: through transparent proof anchoring
* **Secure**: with rapid, localized challenge resolution

It is a foundational design choice for enabling **Bitcoin-anchored ZK computation** that is robust, decentralized, and economically sustainable.
