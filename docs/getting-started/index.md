# How to Get Started

LayerEdge empowers developers, node operators, and integrators to contribute to a decentralized zk-verification network anchored on Bitcoin. Whether you're looking to run a Light Node, submit zk-proofs, or test end-to-end integrations, this section walks you through everything you need to begin.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers the full technical onboarding flow:

* Setting up and running a Light Node for decentralized verification
* Submitting zk-proofs for LayerEdge verification and anchoring
* Testing your integration with real proof data
* Troubleshooting common setup issues
* Best practices for secure and efficient participation

## Repositories You'll Use

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`light-node`](https://github.com/Layer-Edge/light-node) | The node client responsible for validating proof subsets and submitting attestations |
| [`verification-layer-tester`](https://github.com/Layer-Edge/verification-layer-tester) | A proof tester that lets you send zk-proof data via ZeroMQ to test the full pipeline |

## Who Is This For?

This guide is meant for:

* Developers with basic understanding of zero-knowledge proofs and Bitcoin infrastructure
* Teams building rollups, bridges, or zk-dApps that want to anchor proofs on Bitcoin
* Independent operators looking to earn LayerEdge token rewards by running Light Nodes
