# Built on Babylon

LayerEdge's verification layer is powered by **Babylon**'s cryptoeconomic security model, enabling zk-protocols to securely operate within Bitcoin's ecosystem. By leveraging Babylon's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model anchored in Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, LayerEdge offers scalable, cost-efficient zk-proof verification, ensuring that every protocol built on it is secure, decentralized, and verifiable.

## Integration Overview

Babylon's shared security provides economic guarantees that zk-proofs settled on LayerEdge maintain the same integrity as Bitcoin itself. The integration ensures that zk-proofs are not only verifiable but also settled with the highest cryptoeconomic security possible. This enables protocols to confidently use LayerEdge for fast, low-cost verification.

## How Babylon Supports the LayerEdge Verification Layer

Babylon brings cryptoeconomic security to LayerEdge by allowing smaller chains to rent Bitcoin's PoW security. In turn, LayerEdge processes zk-proofs efficiently, ensuring that the computational security of Bitcoin is extended beyond simple transactions to verifiable off-chain execution.

## Key Features:

* **Scalable zk-proof verification:** Babylon's PoS model ensures that all zk-proofs verified on LayerEdge inherit Bitcoin's trusted security.
* **Economic Security:** With Babylon's staking capital backing, LayerEdge provides a cost-effective and secure verification layer, eliminating the need for individual protocols to build their own staking mechanisms.
* **Modular Ecosystem:** By combining Babylon's security guarantees with LayerEdge's aggregation model, protocols can achieve scalable, secure zk-proof verification while reducing costs.

## Benefits for zk-Proof Verifications:

* **Security Backed by Bitcoin:** Every zk-proof verified on LayerEdge is secured by Babylon's economic model, anchored in Bitcoin's PoW.
* **Cost-Efficient:** zk-proof verification is drastically cheaper due to LayerEdge's aggregation and Babylon's shared security model.
* **Modular and Scalable:** The integration allows zk protocols to scale without sacrificing security or decentralization, creating a trustless ecosystem built on Bitcoin's computational security.
