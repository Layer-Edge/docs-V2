# Welcome to LayerEdge

LayerEdge is a dual-layer protocol designed for the People-Backed Internet — where every device can participate in decentralized verification, and every app can anchor trust across chains.

At the core are two tightly integrated systems:

* **edgenOS**: A decentralized zk-verification layer powered by everyday devices
* **Edgen Chain**: A high-performance, EVM-compatible L1 built with the Cosmos SDK

Together, they turn zk-proof verification into a global coordination layer — anchoring aggregated proofs every 24 hours to multiple blockchains.

## Get Started

Choose what you want to do:

### [Using Edgen Chain](/docs/guide/edgenChain)

Set up your wallet, bridge assets, and deploy smart contracts on Edgen Chain — fully EVM-compatible and IBC-ready.

### [Using edgenOS](/docs/guide/edgenOS)

Use the edgenOS browser extension to turn your device into a light verifier and start contributing to LayerEdge's verification network.
