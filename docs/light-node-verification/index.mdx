# Light Node Verification

LayerEdge's Light Node Verification system is a core innovation designed to achieve decentralized, scalable zk-proof validation without compromising security. Rather than requiring every node to validate the entire proof batch, LayerEdge allows each Light Node to **verify only a small, randomly selected subset** of zk-proofs.

This design:

* Dramatically reduces per-node computation
* Maintains collective integrity and correctness of the full batch
* Encourages permissionless participation from a global pool of verifiers

Together, Light Nodes form a **distributed and tamper-resistant zk-verification layer**, where **honest sampling and randomized verification** ensure security with minimal overhead.

## How Light Nodes Work

Light Nodes participate in the validation of zk-proof batches by:

1. Randomly selecting a **subset of zk-proofs** from an aggregated batch.
2. **Retrieving and verifying** only those selected proofs.
3. **Submitting an attestation** or dispute based on their results.
4. Receiving **token rewards** or bonuses for accuracy and fraud detection.

This design allows the network to scale to **millions of zk-proofs** without requiring each verifier to re-execute or review the full set.

## Incentivization & Penalties

| Behavior | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Submitting valid attestations | $EDGEN token rewards |
| Catching invalid proofs | Bonus bounties |
| Failing to verify or lying | Economic penalty / exclusion |

This system creates a robust **economic alignment** that favors honest verification.

## Cross-Protocol Interoperability

Light Nodes are proof-framework agnostic and can:

* Verify Groth16, Halo2, STARK-based proofs, zkVM outputs, and more.
* Participate in verifying **rollups, zkML, DePIN data, identity attestations**, and other modular zk-based protocols.

This general-purpose design ensures that LayerEdge Light Nodes are **not tied to any one application domain** and can evolve alongside zk tooling.

## Summary

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Core Function** | Verifies random subset of aggregated zk-proofs |
| **Security Model** | Random sampling + exponential fraud resistance |
| **Resource Profile** | Lightweight; runs on standard devices |
| **Economic Role** | Earns $EDGEN tokens via validation and fraud detection |
| **Consensus Anchoring** | Synchronized to latest Bitcoin block for randomness fairness |

Light Nodes are the **practical bridge between large-scale zk computation and verifiable finality on Bitcoin**. They form the base layer of decentralized trust within the LayerEdge ecosystem, allowing:

* Anyone to participate in securing zk-proof batches,
* Protocols to offload trust to a resilient validator mesh,
* And the LayerEdge network to scale proof volume indefinitely â€” **without centralized validators or specialized hardware**.
