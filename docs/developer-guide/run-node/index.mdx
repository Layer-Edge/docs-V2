# Run a Node

## Introduction

The LayerEdge CLI Light Node connects to the LayerEdge network to efficiently verify Merkle trees by performing randomized checks of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. It uses a probabilistic security model, relying on aggregated proofs and anchoring verification results on the Bitcoin blockchain, achieving global immutability and trust-minimization.

### Key Features:

* **Automatic Merkle Tree Discovery**: Detects and connects to available Merkle trees automatically.
* **Random Sampling & Verification**: Randomly validates aggregated ZK proofs for scalable security.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Locally generates and verifies ZK proofs using an external prover service.
* **Intelligent Sleep Mechanism**: Optimizes node efficiency by skipping redundant computations on unchanged Merkle trees.
* **Earn Rewards**: Receive network incentives for verified submissions.
* **Secure & Efficient Participation**: No need to store the full blockchain; relies on Bitcoin for final settlement.

## Probabilistic Security Model for Light Nodes

LayerEdge CLI nodes achieve high-security standards without full blockchain data storage. Instead, they perform probabilistic sampling:

### How it Works:

* **Proof Aggregation**: ZK proofs from Bitcoin L2s, DA layers, AI chains, DePin networks, and RWA platforms are aggregated into a single root proof.
* **Bitcoin Settlement**: Root proofs anchored onto Bitcoin, ensuring permanent and global finality.
* **Randomized Verification**: Each node verifies random subsets, ensuring high integrity with minimal computational resources.
* **Exponential Security Guarantee**: Increasing node participation exponentially reduces the risk of invalid proofs.

Minimal Resource Requirements: Even devices with minimal resources can effectively participate.

## Connecting CLI Node with LayerEdge Dashboard

To link your CLI node with the dashboard for **analytics**:

### Fetch Points via CLI

```
https://light-node.layeredge.io/api/cli-node/points/{walletAddress}
```

Replace `{walletAddress}` with your **actual CLI wallet address**.

### Connect to Dashboard

1. Connect your wallet
2. Link your CLI node's Public Key

### Important Notes:

* One CLI wallet **can only** link to one dashboard wallet.
* Linking is **mandatory**, even if the CLI and dashboard wallets are identical.

### Dashboard Monitoring Features

* **Node status** (Active/Inactive)
* **Points tracking & detailed analytics**

## Logging & Monitoring

The node provides comprehensive logs for:

* **Merkle tree discovery**
* **ZK proof generation and verification**
* **Submission status**
* **Performance optimizations** (tree sleep state)

## Security Best Practices

* Always store keys, mnemonics, and AUTHKEY offline.
* Utilize firewall protections and secure SSH configurations.
* Regularly update nodes from official LayerEdge sources.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue:** gRPC connection is inactive.
**Solution:** Verify gRPC connection settings.

**Issue:** Risc0 prover service is not running.
**Solution:** Restart the prover service and check logs.

**Issue:** Incorrect wallet or signature configurations.
**Solution:** Double-check wallet addresses and environment variables.

Consult detailed logs for more specific errors.
